State Management: Utilized @State to manage reactive state variables (wakeUp, sleepAmount, coffeeAmount, etc.) within SwiftUI views.

User Interface Design: Designed a user interface using SwiftUI components like NavigationView, Form, VStack, Text, DatePicker, Stepper, and Button.

Alert Handling: Implemented alert handling using @State and .alert modifier to display feedback messages based on calculations.

Integration with CoreML: Integrated a CoreML model (SleepCalculator) into SwiftUI to predict ideal bedtime based on user inputs (wake-up time, sleep duration, coffee intake).

Error Handling: Implemented error handling using do-catch blocks to manage potential errors from CoreML predictions.

Date and Time Manipulation: Utilized Date and Calendar APIs to manipulate and format date/time components for calculation purposes.
